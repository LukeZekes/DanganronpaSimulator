Murders
Investigations
	-Description of body
	-Variations on "decided to investigate the body" - including support and antag? (based on who is alive/dead?)
	-Investigating rooms
Trials
Random free time events (both location-dependent and independent)
	-Make sure the only ultimate labs available as locations are ones for living students, that have been unlocked
	-Maybe give more variations on the classroom explorations?
Character genders so FTEvents with 'they' or 'their' sound less copy-pasted
